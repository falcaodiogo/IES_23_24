## What to include in the notebook? 
This should be a notebook that you (or other learner) could 
use for study; during the lab activities: take note of key concepts, save some important/useful
links, maybe paste some key visuals on the topics being addressed, etc. Think of the notebook 
as a “notes to self” resource, explaining and summarizing the key concepts and practices of the 
lab.
